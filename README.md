**PAY TO CHALLENGE PLATFORM**

1. **Posting Requires a Stake**
   - Users must stake money (e.g., $1–$50) behind any post they make.
   - The higher the stake, the more visibility it gets (algorithm boosts it).
   - This creates ego-based incentives. People pay to be heard and taken seriously.
2. **Challenging Also Requires a Stake**
   - Anyone can challenge a post by staking _equal_ or _more_ money.
   - The more challengers, the bigger the pool.
3. **The Winner Takes a Cut**
   - After a challenge period (e.g., 24 hours), a vote by a tursted mod panel determines the “winner” and get assistance from AI which analysizes both sides and suggests a winner.
   - If the challenger wins, they get **X% of the combined stake.**
   - If the OP wins, they get **100% of the combined stake**.
   - The winner receives reputation points as a ranking which can grow and makes you more of a verified player. Others can see this reputation ranking.
4. **Business Structure**
   - I take a **platform fee** on each side, win or lose.
   - Users have a financial incentive to continue playing.

**Psychology Behind This:**

- The monetary aspect appeals to those with a gambling mindset.
- The dynamic of challenging and being challenged feeds into our current toxic social discourse which has proven to be a profitable business model (X, Facebook, etc…)
- Earning higher reputation points from winning challenges feeds into a person’s ego and makes their profile become more popular on the platform.
